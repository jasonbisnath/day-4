<p class="big">"VIRGIL ALBOH"
THE STORY OF OFF-WHITE & THE FACE OF FASHION & IT'S CULTURE</p>

<p>There are two things that I think define powerful
creativity: curiosity and obsession.</p>  <p> Our obsession
with serving the athlete and building cutting-edge,
pioneering performance products coupled with
Virgil’s intense curiosity, allowed us to, together, recontextualize
these iconic shoes for a new generation
of Nike enthusiasts. </p> <p> Many of our icons are classics,
and our ability to iterate allows them to remain as
distinctly relevant and as culturally in stride now, as
they were when they were first introduced. </p> <p>
The future insists that we build products that are
distinct and new, remaining constantly on the precipice
of improvement. </p> <p> But, being distinct is actually quite
difficult in modern culture, so that’s where we leverage
the power of innovation through sport. </p>
